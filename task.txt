HTTP 1.1 Its works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn't get its all resources
It uses requests resoure inlining for use getting multiple pages 
it compresses data by itself,



HTTP2 it works on the binary protocol
it allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
it uses HPACK for data compression
HTTP1 and HTTP2 are both communication protocol used for tranferring data over the internet.HTTP1 the traditional protocol,sends requests and responses in a serial manner, leading to potential delays and slower performance .on the other hand, HTTP2 allowes multiplexing enabling multiple requests & responses to be sent simultaneously improving overall speed and efficiency . Additionally HTTP2 inculdes features like 
header compression & SEVER PUSH further enhancing performance . 
overall while HTTP1 has served us well for many years, the adoption of HTTP2 is crucial for faster more 
reliable web experience in todays digital age .
